# Orno-WE514-SetId
Simple Python script to change modbus ID of Orno Power Meters.

Requires Python3 and pymodbus (https://github.com/riptideio/pymodbus, I used pymodbus 2.5.3)

I owe to PeWu's code (https://github.com/PeWu) the solution to enable register writing.
Orno B2C support never answered to my email inquiries.
